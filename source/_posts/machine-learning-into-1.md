Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to "learn" (progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.

From the big company like Facebook, Google, Amazon to new start-ups start using Machine learning as part of there product to provide more personalizes products/services to their customer.

Clearly, machine learning is changing the way we interact with apps today, we can see examples such as,
* Face Detection on Facebook or on your camera.
* How Google personalizes the ads and content that are shown to users based on their behavior.
* Spam checking, done by email services on detecting whether the email is spam or not.
* Recommendations of movies and several products on Amazon or Netflix.
* Amazon Alexa and Google Home are winning the heart of consumers.
* Self-driving Cars are comingâ€¦


As a programmer right now machine learning is obviously the top skill one can acquire right now, Besides my Cloud skills development I am going learn and solve machine learning problem and going to keep notes what I am learning and solving.

I will start with Scikit-learn, Numpy later Tensorflow for deep learning, using python as a language.
